Welcome to the Busybus App!

This is the BusyBus Frontend Prototype. The goal of this project was to apply UX research, visual design and frontend development to develop a view that addresses the problem identified by the client. 

The problem that transit officials had identified was that users in Chicago were having a hard time finding out what buses were arriving and departing from the bus stop at Washington & State. After conducting user research, creating wireframes and conducting user testing, I created a coded prototype for an app called BusyBus, which solves the presented problem by showing the bus schedule for Washington & State.
